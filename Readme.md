#Try Dart

So I updated the site using bootstrap and I think I kept all of the important Id's you were using so that the code could work. If if doesn't I apologize in advance. It's semi-responsive because I couldn't get the ACE editor to behave but it should work ok on mobile webkit browsers. 

The logo is a work in progress, not sure if I completel like it yet but feel free to scrap it or whatever. I kept all of your original files so the new updated one is trydart.html.
